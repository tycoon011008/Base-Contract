# Base Protocol smart contracts

Base Protocol is a decentralized elastic supply protocol for creating indices of other tokens. It maintains a price peg by adjusting supply directly to and from wallet holders based on a data feed generated by off-chain oracles. You can read the [whitepaper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O9V4vjygGmno90NAXSDtj9IwZAelZCsj/view) for the motivation and a complete description of the protocol.

This repository is a collection of smart contracts that implement the protocol on the Ethereum blockchain.
